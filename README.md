# capstone-outdoors

In this capstone project I worked on configuring a search database to find a specific item within the parameters of the search via a dropdown menu.

An interesting piece a code that I wrote is the all of the search page js, because it was extremely difficult and I think I also got it wrong, because I used the second search parameter to filter the results even further.
